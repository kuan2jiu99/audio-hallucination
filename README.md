## Overview

## Abstract
Large audio-language models (LALMs) enhance traditional
large language models by integrating audio perception capabilities, allowing them to tackle audio-related tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of
LALMs across various tasks, yet overlooking their reliability,
particularly concerning issues like object hallucination. In our
study, we introduce methods to assess the extent of object hallucination of publicly available LALMs. Our findings reveal that
LALMs are comparable to specialized audio captioning models in their understanding of audio content, but struggle to answer discriminative questions, specifically those requiring the
identification of the presence of particular object sounds within
an audio clip. This limitation highlights a critical weakness in
current LALMs: their inadequate understanding of discriminative queries. Moreover, we explore the potential of prompt engineering to enhance LALMsâ€™ performance on discriminative
questions.

        - Random Sampling: `kuanhuggingface/AudioHallucination_AudioCaps-Random`

        - Adversarial Sampling: `kuanhuggingface/AudioHallucination_AudioCaps-Adversarial`

## Usage
Description of fields in the dataset:

- `audio_index`
    - The ID in AudioCaps, e.g., Y7fmOlUlwoNg corresponds to Y7fmOlUlwoNg.wav
- `prompt_text`
    - The input text prompt.
- `object`
    - The object that large audio-language models need to recognize in the audio.
- `attribute`
    - Indicates whether the object truly exists in the audio; positive means it exists, negative means it does not.
- `label`
    - The correct answer corresponding to the prompt_text.
- `sampling`
    - How the negative sample object is selected; random means it is chosen randomly from the AudioCaps test split, excluding the ground truth for that audio.
