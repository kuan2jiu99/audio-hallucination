## Citation
If you find our work useful, please kindly cite the following papers:

The first paper aims to provide a more comprehensive analysis of audio hallucination, covering aspects such as object existence, temporal order, and object attributes. It also proposes simple and effective methods to improve the performance of these models.

The second paper is the first to systematically analyze and explore object hallucination phenomena in large audio-language models.
